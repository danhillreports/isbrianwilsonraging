It was gonna be epic. The first ESPN Sunday Night Baseball game of the year, Hyun-Jin Ryu pitching seven shutout innings against the division-rival Padres.

Brian Wilson enters in the bottom of the 8th to initiate the Dodger setup-closer sequence. The FanGraphs Win Probability chart shows pretty well what happened.

The game-changing, pinch-hit Seth Smith homerun. The error, the stolen base sending the game further in San Diego's favor. Wilson faced five batters, recorded no outs and allowed three runs (two earned). He earned the loss, and finished the game with -.706 WPA, according to [FanGraphs](http://www.fangraphs.com/wins.aspx?date=2014-03-30&team=Dodgers&dh=0&season=2014).

Fail. Rage.

The B-Weez PitchFX show every pitch Padres hit in play was a slider:

Naive pitching coach says "Don't throw sliders!" But Dodgers color guy Rick Monday had some wisdom on KLAC:

"Brian Wilson is pitching very unlike Brian Wilson. He hasn't found the plate with consistency, and when he has found the plate, it's been the big part of it."

Only five of the 12 fastballs and cutters Wilson threw were strikes, according to the PitchFX data. Inability to throw fastballs for strikes leads to negative WPA and hanging head in shame.
