Brian Wilson's bullpen ERA took another hit in Miami when he recorded two outs but allowed a three-run Marcell Ozuna home run. The outing got out of control when Wilson lost control of a cutter and hit Adeiny Hechavarria at 78 mph.

Wilson then walked Giancarlo Stanton on four pitches before giving up the bomb.

Hechavarria was the third batter Weez has hit with a pitch in 2014. According to [Baseball Refernce](http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/w/wilsobr01-pitch.shtml#pitching_standard::22), the only other year Wilson hit as many batters was 2008, when he appeared in 63 games.

Miami was Wilson's 11th appearance, so we can safely say that he will hit 17.18 batters if he appears in 63 games this year.

Just for lulz here are gifs of the other two batters Weez hit this year: Ryan Howard and Lance Nix of the Phillies.
