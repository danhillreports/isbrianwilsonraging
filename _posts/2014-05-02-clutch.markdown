He didn't get credit for a win or save, but Brian Wilson was actually kinda clutch last night.

Weez came in with the game tied during the 8th inning of the second game of a doubleheader ([called it]({{ site.baseurl }}/games/2014/05/01/doubleheader.html) against the Twins after Paco Rodriguez gave up a walk and a single to start the inning.

Minnesota's win expectancy was at 76.1% with two on and no outs when Weez entered. The game was back even at 50% when Wilson's work was done.

The outing got pretty intense when Brian Dozier stole third base uncontested, but Weez struck out the next two batters like a boss to end the inning.

According to the [Average Leverage Index](http://www.fangraphs.com/blogs/get-to-know-leverage-index/), it was the most pressure Wilson faced in an outing this season.

The Twins felt the pressure of the situation too: Trevor Plouffe had a little moment in the dugout after flying out on a full count against Wilson.
