The Dodgers' three-game visit to Washington, D.C. was rough &mdash; the end of a 10-game roadtrip with rainouts, double headers and extra innings. But for Brian Wilson, D.C. was pretty sweet.

Weez pitched in two games against the Nationals, and even the Dodgers lost both games, Wilson allowed no runs! That's a feat for a guy who on average allows a run per inning, right?

He did, however, throw 51 pitches in two innings.

Stats aside, what really made D.C. awesome for -Weez perspective was [this](http://www.nbcwashington.com/blogs/capital-games/Brian-Wilsons-Doppelganger-Visits-Nationals-Park-258093561.html) [guy](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/dc-sports-bog/wp/2014/05/06/bearded-dodgers-fan-at-nats-park-looks-like-brian-wilson-is-best-dodgers-fan/).
