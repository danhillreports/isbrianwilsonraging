This site has been quiet because there hasn't been much statistical rage in the Brian Wilson world.

Weez allowed no runs in any of his four appearances on the road between May 16 and May 23 &mdash; his longest scoreless streak of the season. During that period he walked just one of the 15 batters he faced, got all three outs in each of the innings he threw and worked his ugly bullpen ERA down from 10.22 to 7.71.

Foreshadowing!

Hyun-Jin Ryu took a perfect game into the 8th inning on Memorial Day, but lost his stuff and Wilson runners on first and second with a three-run lead.

Wilson struck out the first batter he faced and took Skip Schumacher to a 1-2 count. Then, with Dodgers fans doing the wave, it got weird.

Weez threw five balls in a row, gave up a two-run double to Billy Hamilton, threw four more balls to walk Zack Cozart, and got yanked.

Wilson improved the Reds' win probability by 19 percentage points, but Kenley Jansen prevented any more runs and recorded a four-out save.

By baseball statistics logic, Weez didn't get charged with a run. But it was definitely a rage-worthy performance.

At least Weez looked awesome in the camo.
