Forget the question "Is Brian Wilson raging?". Everyone in LA is asking, "Why is Brian Wilson sad?"

Weez had just pitched a scoreless 8th inning against the Pirates, but he was probably bummed that the Dodgers couldn't rally and lost 2-1.

Another reason Weez could be gloomy is Alan Harrison's [ranking of relievers for Fangraphs](http://www.fangraphs.com/fantasy/scheming-for-relief-monitoring-middle-reliever-tiers/). Harrison classified pitchers in tiers named after beers, and Wilson was put in the unflattering "Yellow Fizzy Beer" group.

Even more troubling, [I put Harrison's table of relievers in Google Docs](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1jcgj-KuZoWwPwpmsgDEuZjF6Ghyfp-sy3vz9-LXQkpY/edit?usp=sharing) and found Weez ranked worst in several statistical measures: [WHIP](http://www.fangraphs.com/library/pitching/whip/), [FIP](http://www.fangraphs.com/library/pitching/fip/) and [ERA](http://www.fangraphs.com/library/pitching/era/).

Cheer up B-Weez, it's almost bobblehead day!
