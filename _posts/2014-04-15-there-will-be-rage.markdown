There's media drama surrounding the roster moves necessary for B-Weez to return from a stint on the disabled list.

Wilson went on the 15-day DL following his epic loss against to Padres on March 30, but the Dodgers went 7-3 in his absence. Someone from the strong Dodger bullpen would have to be sent down to bring back Weez:

The Los Angeles Times highlighted the merits of [Chris Withrow](http://dodgers.mlb.com/team/player.jsp?player_id=519437), a 25-year-old reliever who has struck out nine batters and allowed one hit in his first six innings of work in 2014:

Adding to the drama: Wilson's DL time expires as the Dodgers begin a three-game series in San Francisco. The [last time the B-Weez was in AT&T Park](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kHgB_B7Q8QQ)?

Whatever happens, someone will rage.
