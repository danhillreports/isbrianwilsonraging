Vin Scully called Brian Wilson a "workhorse" last night, citing the 20+ pitches Wilson threw in each of his first two games back from the disabled list. Looking just at pitch counts, last night was Wilson's easiest outing yet.

The Dodgers were in a 2-2 tie with the Philadelphia Phillies in Los Angeles when Weez came in, and he retired leadoff batter Domonic Brown in two pitches. Sweet!

B-Weez had to make things a little interesting. He hit Jayson Nix with a slider in a two-strike count. Suddenly, with a runner on first in the top of the 8th, win probability favored the Phillies by half a percentage point, [according to fangraphs](http://www.fangraphs.com/wins.aspx?date=2014-04-22&team=Dodgers&dh=0&season=2014).

But Nix was caught stealing, Weez [finished with a +.093 WPA](http://www.fangraphs.com/wins.aspx?date=2014-04-22&team=Dodgers&dh=0&season=2014) and watched from the dugout as J.P. Howell earned the extra-inning loss. Basic night for B-Weez.
