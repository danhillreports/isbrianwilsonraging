It's getting closer to baseball crunch time, and Dodger pitchers are looking ["a little iffy"](http://www.latimes.com/sports/dodgers/la-sp-dodgers-20140816-story.html) in the eyes of LA Times headline writers following a Friday night game against Milwaukee.

Relievers Jamey Wright and Brandon League allowed a five-spot in the eighth inning, Hyun-Jin Ryu hit the 15-day DL and Zach Greinke labored.

This was two days after Brian Wilson's smooth second half was interrupted by one of those [awful outings](http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/gameday/index.jsp?gid=2014_08_14_lanmlb_atlmlb_1&mode=wrap&c_id=la#gid=2014_08_14_lanmlb_atlmlb_1&mode=recap&c_id=la) that required Kenley Jansen to get a four-out save.
