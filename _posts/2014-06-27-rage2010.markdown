Last night in Los Angeles Brian Wilson earned the win in a [1-0 game](http://losangeles.dodgers.mlb.com/mlb/gameday/index.jsp?c_id=la&gid=2014_06_26_slnmlb_lanmlb_1&lang=en&mode=wrap) after Josh Beckett pitched seven shutout innings. Almost 24 hours before, Wilson earned his first save of the season, which [was pretty awesome]({{ site.baseurl }}/games/2014/06/26/usa-usa.html).

It's only the third time Weezy has earned a big-league win the day after earning a big-league save. The two previous instances were in 2010 against [the Cubs](http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/gl.cgi?id=wilsobr01&t=p&year=2010&share=0.21#234-235-sum:pitching_gamelogs) and [the Phillies in the NLDS](http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/gl.cgi?id=wilsobr01&t=p&year=0&post=1&share=1.73#5-6-sum:pitching_gamelogs_post).

The 2010 season was [supremely epic](http://m.mlb.com/video/v12948715/?query=giants%2Bworld%2Bseries%2B2010) for Brian Wilson. Add the FACTs that [USA advanced from its World Cup group]({{ site.baseurl }}/post-assets/2014-06-26-usa-usa/usa.png) and last night was Brian Wilson bobblehead night at Dodger Stadium, and you just have to rage.

Of course the [haters are coming out](http://www.sportsmedia101.com/losangelesdodgers/2014/06/26/will-don-mattingly%E2%80%99s-faith-in-brian-wilson-pay-off-for-the-los-angeles-dodgers/) as Weezy is finding the groove. But Weez just earned a save and a win in consecutive days. You can't argue with wins. [*](http://www.hardballtimes.com/lets-get-rid-of-pitching-wins/)
