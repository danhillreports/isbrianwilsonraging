It seems pretty nice in Los Angeles: Clayton Kershaw pitched an [almost perfect no-hitter](http://m.mlb.com/video/topic/70087564/v33848821/?game_pk=381612), Brian Wilson's ERA has been steadily dropping, the Kings won the Stanley Cup.

But there's still reason to rage: my "Brian Wilson" email alerts stopped and posts on this site have fallen way off track. Sorry about that.

Folks have been asking me, "how's Weezy's fastball?" I turned to Baseball Savant's sweet [pitchFX search](http://baseballsavant.com/pitchfx_search.php?hfPT=ff%7Cft%7C&hfZ=&hfGT=R%7C&hfPR=&hfAB=&pid%5B%5D=451216&hfBB=&hfHL=&hfCount=&ddlYear=2014&ddlPlayer=pitcher&ddlMin=0&ddlPitcherHand=&ddlBatterHand=&ddlVGT=&ddlVLT=&ddlDistGT=&ddlDistLT=&txtGameDateGT=&txtGameDateLT=&ddlTeam=&ddlPosition=&hfRO=&ddlHomeRoad=&hfIN=&hfOT=&ddlGroupBy=name&ddlSort=desc&ddlMinABs=0&ddlSBSuccess=&txtPx1=&txtPx2=&txtPz1=&txtPz2=&ddlRPXGT_ft=&ddlRPXGT_in=&ddlRPXLT_ft=&ddlRPXLT_in=&ddlRPYGT_ft=&ddlRPYGT_in=&ddlRPYLT_ft=&ddlRPYLT_in=&txtBAGT=&txtBALT=&txtBLGT=&txtBLLT=&txtSRGT=&txtSRLT=&txtSDGT=&txtSDLT=#results).

Wilson's average fastball velocity this year is <strong>92.6 mph</strong> with a 1.9 standard deviation.

After some variance in the first two months of the year, that regression line shows Wilson's fastballs stabilizing around 92 mph over the past month.

Weezy's fastest pitches this season are still those [96.4 mph fastballs he threw in San Francisco]({{ site.url }}/games/2014/04/18/vs-giants.html), but he's hit 95 on the radar gun 11 times since that game.
