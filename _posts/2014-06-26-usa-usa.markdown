You won't believe what happened in Kansas City last night. BRIAN WILSON SAVED A GAME.

<iframe src='http://m.mlb.com/shared/video/embed/embed.html?content_id=34047645&topic_id=53317474&width=400&height=224&property=mlb' width='400' height='224' frameborder='0'>Your browser does not support iframes.</iframe>

It was ["unconventional"](http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/gameday/index.jsp?gid=2014_06_25_lanmlb_kcamlb_1&mode=recap&c_id=la), but Weezy earned his first big league save of the 2014 season by recording the final three outs of the Dodgers' 5-4 victory over the Royals.

His first big league save since joining the Los Angeles Dodgers.

His first big league save since <strong>[April 12, 2012](http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/gameday/index.jsp?gid=2012_04_12_sfnmlb_colmlb_1&mode=wrap#gid=2012_04_12_sfnmlb_colmlb_1&mode=video)</strong>, when he [injured his robot arm](http://m.mlb.com/video/?content_id=20644839&c_id=mlb) and had another Tommy John Surgery.

That means it's been <strong>805 days</strong> since Wilson's last save. More than two years since this:

A few hours before Wilson's epic save, Weezy's old teammate Tim Lincecum completed his second no-hitter in as many seasons. But whatev, these days a Brian Wilson save is way more rare than a Tim Lincecum no-hitter.
