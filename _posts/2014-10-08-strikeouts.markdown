Brian Wilson struck out two Nationals &mdash; including former teammate Nate Schierholtz &mdash; in his first September pitching appearance.

However, Weez struck out only two more batters in his [nine other appearances](http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/gl.cgi?id=wilsobr01&t=p&year=2014&share=0.86#385-394-sum:pitching_gamelogs) that month. In September he won one game, lost one game, earned three holds, and recorded the final three outs of the home victory against the San Francisco Giants that clinched the NL West.

St. Louis eliminated the Dodgers in the NLDS, and Weez did not make a postseason appearance. Wilson [exercised his player option](http://www.mlbdailydish.com/2014/10/8/6946523/brian-wilson-exercises-player-option-for-2015-dodgers) to return to the Dodgers in 2015, but we won't be seeing his beard on the mound for a while. Fortunately we have gifs to repeat forever and remind us of the four batters he struck out in September with PitchFX notes from [Baseball Savant](http://baseballsavant.com/pitchfx_search.php?hfPT=&hfZ=&hfGT=R%7C&hfPR=&hfAB=28%7C29%7C&ddlStadium=&hfBB=&hfHL=&pid%5B%5D=451216&hfCount=&ddlYear=2014&ddlPlayer=pitcher&ddlMin=0&ddlPitcherHand=&ddlBatterHand=&ddlVGT=&ddlVLT=&ddlDistGT=&ddlDistLT=&txtAngleGT=&txtAngleLT=&txtGameDateGT=2014-09-01&txtGameDateLT=2014-09-30&ddlTeam=&ddlPosition=&hfRO=&ddlHomeRoad=&hfIN=&hfOT=&ddlGroupBy=name&ddlSort=desc&ddlMinABs=0&ddlSBSuccess=&txtPx1=&txtPx2=&txtPz1=&txtPz2=&ddlRPXGT_ft=&ddlRPXGT_in=&ddlRPXLT_ft=&ddlRPXLT_in=&ddlRPYGT_ft=&ddlRPYGT_in=&ddlRPYLT_ft=&ddlRPYLT_in=&txtBAGT=&txtBALT=&txtBLGT=&txtBLLT=&txtSRGT=&txtSRLT=&txtSDGT=&txtSDLT=#results).
