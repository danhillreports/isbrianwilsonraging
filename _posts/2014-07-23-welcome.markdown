The second half of the 2014 season is underway (crazy) and Brian Wilson returned to the mound after a long break due in part to his absence from the All Star Game ([ridiculous](http://isbrianwilsonraging.com/2014/07/16/allstar.html)).

Reasons for positive rage: Weezy's second half ERA is a perfect 0, and he has two strike outs in two appearances.

Also, since Weez pitched on 17 days of rest after his [DL stint](http://isbrianwilsonraging.com/games/2014/04/15/there-will-be-rage.html) and on 14 days with the All Star break, we have this breaking news from Baseball-Reference.com:

<p>¯\_(ツ)_/¯</p>

Weezy threw 35 pitches in his first two appearances of the second half, and the fastest of his nine fastballs was clocked at [92.8 mph](http://baseballsavant.com/pitchfx_search.php?hfPT=&hfZ=&hfGT=R%7C&hfPR=&hfAB=&ddlStadium=&hfBB=&hfHL=&pid%5B%5D=451216&hfCount=&ddlYear=2014&ddlPlayer=pitcher&ddlMin=0&ddlPitcherHand=&ddlBatterHand=&ddlVGT=&ddlVLT=&ddlDistGT=&ddlDistLT=&txtGameDateGT=2014-07-20&txtGameDateLT=2014-07-22&ddlTeam=&ddlPosition=&hfRO=&ddlHomeRoad=&hfIN=&hfOT=&ddlGroupBy=name&ddlSort=desc&ddlMinABs=0&ddlSBSuccess=&txtPx1=&txtPx2=&txtPz1=&txtPz2=&ddlRPXGT_ft=&ddlRPXGT_in=&ddlRPXLT_ft=&ddlRPXLT_in=&ddlRPYGT_ft=&ddlRPYGT_in=&ddlRPYLT_ft=&ddlRPYLT_in=&txtBAGT=&txtBALT=&txtBLGT=&txtBLLT=&txtSRGT=&txtSRLT=&txtSDGT=&txtSDLT=#results).

But he's also thrown two sub-75 mph pitches...

PitchFX called them [curveballs](http://baseballsavant.com/pitchfx_search.php?hfPT=cu%7C&hfZ=&hfGT=R%7C&hfPR=&hfAB=&ddlStadium=&hfBB=&hfHL=&pid%5B%5D=451216&hfCount=&ddlYear=2014&ddlPlayer=pitcher&ddlMin=0&ddlPitcherHand=&ddlBatterHand=&ddlVGT=&ddlVLT=&ddlDistGT=&ddlDistLT=&txtGameDateGT=2014-07-20&txtGameDateLT=2014-07-22&ddlTeam=&ddlPosition=&hfRO=&ddlHomeRoad=&hfIN=&hfOT=&ddlGroupBy=name&ddlSort=desc&ddlMinABs=0&ddlSBSuccess=&txtPx1=&txtPx2=&txtPz1=&txtPz2=&ddlRPXGT_ft=&ddlRPXGT_in=&ddlRPXLT_ft=&ddlRPXLT_in=&ddlRPYGT_ft=&ddlRPYGT_in=&ddlRPYLT_ft=&ddlRPYLT_in=&txtBAGT=&txtBALT=&txtBLGT=&txtBLLT=&txtSRGT=&txtSRLT=&txtSDGT=&txtSDLT=#results), but could it be...

Stay tuned for an epic second half.
